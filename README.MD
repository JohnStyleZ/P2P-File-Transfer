Our software company, P2P File Transfer, has created a safe way to share information by facilitating encrypted file sharing. Because of the rapid growth for the need of encryption use, our product offers tremendous advantages to company professionals, as well as the thousands of other people who use networks like the internet to share information every day.

Per Wireshark analysis, files are encrypted before being sent to the other party using TCP. The potential market for the product is very promising, because we solved the problem of how to privately transfer files.

Our P2P File Transfer software is a prototype with the requirement to meet in person to provide/receive the Host Name/IP, Port Name, and Registration PIN— alternatively this information can be mailed. Additionally, a cell phone with the Google Authenticator App and a working email address will be needed to use our software.

P2P File Transfer software can deliver secure file sharing capacity without internet connection required as it functions on a LAN. P2P File Transfer software does encryption internally so you do not have to worry about storing your block encryption key(s). Since P2P File Transfer software encrypts your files, there is no need to worry about snooping on the network any longer.  Two-factor authentication can thwart middle-man-attacks as only you will have your cell phone and know its passcode to use it. User friendly interface makes secured file sharing a simple process.
