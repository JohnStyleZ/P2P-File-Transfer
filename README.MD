\f0\fs24 \cf0 Our software was developed in Python. It is built with email delivered download file\
options that consist of \'93Receiver\'94 and \'93Sender\'94. P2P File Transfer software starts with a\
Registration PIN, continues with Two-Factor Authentication powered by Google\
Authenticator, and finishes with Two-Stage Encryption. Our software uses both AES\
symmetric encryption as well as RSA asymmetric encryption to avoid file size limitations\
per AES(Brent).\
\
Per Wireshark analysis, files are encrypted before being sent to the other party using\
TCP. The potential market for the product is very promising, because we solved the\
problem of how to privately transfer files.\
\
Our Software\'97Our P2P File Transfer software is a prototype with the requirement to\
meet in person to provide/receive the Host Name/IP, Port Name, and Registration\
PIN\'97 alternatively this information can be mailed. Additionally, a cell phone with the\
Google Authenticator App and a working email address will be needed to use our\
software.\
\
Additional P2P File Transfer Software Benefits\'97P2P File Transfer software can\
deliver secure file sharing capacity without\'a0internet connection required as it functions\
on a LAN. P2P File Transfer software does encryption internally so you do not have to\
worry about storing your block encryption key(s). Since P2P File Transfer software\
encrypts your files, there is no need to worry about snooping on the network any longer.\
\'a0Two-factor authentication can thwart middle-man-attacks as only you will have your cell\
phone and know its passcode to use it. User friendly interface makes secured file\
sharing a simple process.\

How to get started: Beginner User &amp; Advanced User guides\
Beginner User Guide:\
People acting as \'93Receiver\'94 and \'93Sender\'94 will need to meet in person to provide/receive\
the Host Name/IP, Port Name, and Registration PIN. If people acting as \'93Receiver\'94 and\
\'93Sender\'94 cannot meet in person, we recommend the \'93Sender\'94 request the details in\
writing so the \'93Receiver\'94 can physically mail you the needed information via FedEx. Cell\
phone needed for authentication and must have QR Scanner app present. Email that is\
working is required to receive P2P File Transfer software download files.\
